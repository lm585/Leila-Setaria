To remind you, below was the criteria you used in your last script for SNP detection 

•	1 WT + 7 EMS samples
•	Select  1 EMS sample as a target. Combine the WT and the other 6 EMS samples as a control. Compare the control with the target sample, 
•	1 read cutoff. 
•	For the target sample, I used  85% for homozygousity, say T; The same allele, T, in the combined control < 5%.
Only include substitutions with : G (WT) -> A (target sample) substitution or C->T substitution. In addition,  the control has  no mutation with respect to the reference, the target sample has mutation

Could you run 552 and 745 once with the last script you wrote for SNP detection  and once with the last one you wrote for indel detection.
